# Lab 8 - *A mock Tinder app featuring gestures and custom transitions*

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [X] User can drag card using a pan gesture (+1pt)
- [X] Card rotates as user pans (+1pt)
- [X] Card animates when user ends panning gesture (+2pt)
- [X] User can view profile - basic modal transition (+1pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User can view profile - custom modal transition (+2pt)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to use a nav bar instead of the image view to go back to home screen.
2. Using different gestures to make swipe the card.
